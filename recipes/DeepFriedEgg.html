    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In this recipe, I will show you why the crispy, deep fried egg is superior to any other style of egg you will ever have.
        This method is most well-known across asian countries where an egg is cooked in a hot wok with a good amount of oil. In
        many western countries, cooking an egg like this may be slightly shunned upon due to "ruining the delicate texture" of the 
        egg whites, but I can assure you that once you've had eggs prepared this way, you may never go back.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>an egg</li>
        <li>peanut oil</li>
        <li>premium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan at medium-high till smoking</li>
        <li>Add peanut oil (note: olive oil will not work as well due to its low smoking point, you can substitute with grape seed oil if peanut oil is not available near you).</li>
        <li>Add egg to pan and continue to baste the egg with the hot oil so it cooks the top. You will know you are doing it correctly when bubbles form on top from cooking the egg whites.</li>
        <li>Once the edges start to form a nice golden brown crust, remove the egg and place on toast or just plain white rice. I like to season my egg with soy sauce, but you can use plain salt and pepper, it's really up to your preference!</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
