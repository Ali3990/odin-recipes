    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is Chuanqi's famous, super-duper, deluxe waffles recipe!</p>
    
    <p>In this recipe, you will learn why this famous dish received, not 1, but 3 michelin stars. It has crispy edges, a fluffy interior and scrumptious bite. The great thing about this recipe is how simple it is to make! If you make a big batch, you can even freeze it and still receive 2 michelin stars!</p>
    
    <p>To make this famous breakfast dish, you will need only a few simple ingredients:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Butter (unsalted, or salted and omit the salt from earlier)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Milk</li>
        <li>1 Whole Egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-step instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Mix all the dry ingredients into a bowl. Whisk until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>2. Add milk and all other wet ingredients and mix until no lumps.</li>
        <li>3. Pre-heat a $25 waffle iron from Target. You may use a higher-end waffle maker, but it just won't be michelin-star worthy... </li>
        <li>4. Fill the griddle with batter until it fills all edges. Next, fold down the waffle iron and press. Don't let go no matter what, even if the steam is scalding your fingers. The baking powder will make the batter rise and the top part will push out.</li>
        <li>(Note: you can use a higher-end waffle maker that locks it in so you don't get scalded by the hot steam, but where's the fun in that?</li>
        
    </ol>
